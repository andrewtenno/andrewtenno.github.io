# Recap
Baby’s first marathon. Decided that there wasn’t any reason to keep putting it off and I’ve been semi-training since the start of the year anyway.

Goals:
- Sub 4:00 - ✅
- Sub 3:30 - ✅
- Run the entire route - ✅

I’ve been running since January of 2016. At that time I was obese, couldn’t run more than half a mile before stopping, and was pretty depressed. Running has changed my life in so many ways, nearly all for the better (not as much of a fan of the injuries). I’ve proved to myself that I can do something I once thought impossible on [that first run in 2016](https://www.strava.com/activities/4143941348) and deemed unrealistic on days over the years even as I’ve gotten stronger.

### Pre-Race / Training
I signed up for this race extremely late (the Tuesday prior). While I've not been specifically training for a marathon I've been consistently running 40-50 mile weeks since the start of the year and felt like I was in good enough shape to give it a shot.

Generally my weekly training has been:
- Long Run (13+ miles, peaking at 22 miles) on Sundays
- Recovery Run on Monday (4 miles)
- Little Speed Work (flat 800m repeats)
- Tempo Runs Tuesday / Thursday (5 miles)
- 5-8 miles on Wednesdays
- 5 easy miles Friday / Saturday

Because of the rain this winter I've done a good bit of treadmill training. While it isn't my favorite it allowed me to focus on some more hilly work I would normally not be focusing on.

### Getting to the Race
Took an Uber to Union Station, which had shuttles to the start line at Dodger Stadium

### Getting Home
Getting home was a huge pain. My original plan was to Uber back as well but given the insane traffic I decided that wasn't the best idea. I tried to catch a Metro bus (the 4) back to Santa Monica but after the driver passed a bunch of us I decided to walk a couple miles down to the Expo Line.

### Nutrition
- Food
    - Banana + Lara Bar prior to race
    - 6 [Gu Originals (with Caffeine)](https://guenergy.com/products/energy-gel) taken every ~30 minutes
    - Stomach mostly felt fine, though started to not feel great at gel 6
    - 1 [Gu Stroopwafel](https://guenergy.com/products/gu-energy-stroopwafel) taken at the halfway point
- Hydration
    - 1 Liquid IV after waking up
    - Electrolytes every other aid station (about every two miles)
    - Water every aid station (about each mile) mostly to pour on my head / back
    - Felt pretty hydrated throughout the race, even had to stop once to pee

### Next Steps
I'd like to see how close I can get to Sub-3 by the end of the year. I think if I commit to an actual training plan + speed work I can get there, my lack of a consistent training plan feels like the main issue at this point.

To make myself commit to this I purchased a couple marathon training books:
- [Advanced Marathoning (Pfitzinger)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/149256866X)
- [Hansons Marathon Method: Run Your Fastest Marathon the Hansons Way (Humphrey)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1937715485)

Will take most of the next week easy and then start picking up my training again.
