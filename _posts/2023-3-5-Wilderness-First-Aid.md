I took a two day Wilderness First Aid course through REI / NOLS. The course was pretty interesting, covering topics such as:
- Basic First Aid
- Patient Triage
- Situation Evaluation

In my opinion the most valuable piece was the last item - getting a detailed framework for evaluation of patients and how to determine whether or not to evacuate. I feel a lot more comfortable going into the backcountry with this class!
