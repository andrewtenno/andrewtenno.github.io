# John Muir Trail - 2020

## Background

I hiked the JMT in August - September of 2020. Unfortunately it has taken me quite a while to get a full report for this hike up, but I guess that is just life getting in the way.

- This hike took place during the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, which left many folks sheltering indoors under quarantine orders for a prolonged period of time. In many ways this hike was a step into another world; where contagious disease wasn't at the front of all of our minds and folks were able to be social as in the days prior to the pandemic.
- The end of my hike overlapped with the [Creek Fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creek_Fire_(2020)) - an incredibly destructive event that burned over 375,000 acres and caused vast plumes of smoke to cover the horizon.

## General Thoughts

Hiking the JMT made me fall in love with thru-hiking. There is something special about being out in the wilderness with only what you can carry - a return to a simpler way of life where your biggest concern is what you'll have for dinner and how far your feet will carry you that day. 

The other aspect of this trip I truly enjoyed was the people. Although I didn't go into the hike with the intention of prioritizing the social aspect (my primary goal was to experience the solitude of the wilderness) nearly every person I met on the trip was ecstatic about being outdoors and experiencing the true beauty of the world. In very few instances in life do you get exposed to people from all over the world with various different backgrounds who all are brought together to experience the trail.
