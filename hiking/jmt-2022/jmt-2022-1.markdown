# Recap
Started off my JMT section hike by parking my car at Mammoth Mountain and taking YARTS into Yosemite. Trip was pretty uneventful. I ate my breakfast and started my hike out from the Mono Pass trailhead. The first few miles were through beautiful forests and meadows, with tons of deer around.

The weather forecast for the day called for thunderstorms and showers. We didnâ€™t get the thunderstorms but the showers turned into heavy rain. Yesterday it poured and thunderstorms in mammoth so I guess we got a bit lucky.  I made it up Parker Pass without any rain but but as I began the climb up Koip Pass the sprinkles began and intensified as I reached the summit. It poured at the summit and all the way down to Alger Lakes. I was completely drenched and the descent was pretty terrible in the wet terrain - the trail was really tough to follow. I give Koip a 3/10, would not do again in the rain.

I finished hiking around 1 PM and ate lunch. I decided to put up my rain fly and ground sheet in case it rained and that proved to be a great call. It poured from around 2-4 PM, though I was dry in the tent.

After the rain let up I fished for a couple hours and managed to catch a couple nice Golden Trout and a couple Rainbow Golden hybrids. One pretty good sized Golden managed to shake off right at the bank, huge bummer. Unfortunately it got pretty windy so the fishing was tough and I only caught 5 in total.
