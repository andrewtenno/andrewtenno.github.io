# Recap
Manged to snag a last-minute [River Trail Permit](https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/inyo/recreation/recarea/?recid=21264) so did a quick overnight up to Thousand Island and back. I was originally trying to extend this to do a loop over Iceberg Lake but decided to cut the trip short due to the trail experiencing some landslides and becoming impassable. Was a really hot couple days and the mosquitos were out in force as well.

Was my first time up at Ediza / Iceberg and was extremely impressed by their beauty!

Thousand Island was pretty crowded, but beautiful as always. Instead of another photo of Banner / Ritter, here's an Indian Paintbrush:
