# Recap
What. A. Day. 

Started at Alger Lakes with some morning fishing while my gear from last night dried out (socks, gaiters, sun hoody, ground sheet). Managed to catch one good sized golden trout.

I hit the trail a little late - around 9 AM. the journey over Gem Pass and down to Gem Lake was a slog, the descent went on forever and the footing was pretty muddy and slippery. I got a great view of June Mountain and Gull/June lakes on the top of Gem Pass (and even got cell service).

I made the journey up past Clark Lakes and up and over Agnew Pass to Thousand Island Lake. My plan was to stop there for lunch and continue down to Garnett Lake or Ediza Lake to camp but things turned out a bit differently than planned. 

While having lunch it started to sprinkle. According to the Garmin weather forecast we only had a 20% chance of rain but the sky looked dark and pretty ominous so I decided to look for a campsite at Thousand Island Lake where I could set up the tent and take a break. 

I did a bit of fishing and the rain started coming down pretty hard around 2 PM. The next hour or so was filled with hail and hard rain - so hard that it splashed up and into my tent from under the rain fly. I need to be sure to make sure my pitch doesnâ€™t allow for that in the future. The hail finally ended and I was able to get back out and do some more fishing. I only caught one fish, but it was a really nice rainbow that pulled the hell out of my ultralight rod / reel. It started to rain again so I retreated back into my tent. From 5-7 it absolutely poured, so much so that a river started running underneath my tent (thankfully the ground sheet kept me dry). There were bolts of lightning and loud thunderclaps all around my tent, and the rain seemed to get harder and harder.

Finally the rain slowly turned into sprinkles and I was able to get out of my tent and make dinner. The dark clouds left a beautiful set of double rainbows along with a beautiful set of pink clouds surrounding Mt. Ritter for sunset. I ended the night with some more fishing (not catching) while admiring the beauty Ansel Adams attempted to share with the world so many years ago - all thanks to the rain.
