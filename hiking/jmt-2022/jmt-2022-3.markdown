# Recap
I slept in a bit and started the day off to a beautiful, hot durian at Thousand Island Lake. Unfortunately much of my gear (including my tent) was soaked wet and I spent an hour letting it dry out on some nearby granite rocks. I didnâ€™t hit the trail until around 9 AM and made the slow descent down to Reds Meadow. 

I walked by all my favorite lakes - from Thousand Island to Garnett to Shadow each lake in the Middle San Joaquin drainage is absolutely stunning and worthy of spending time just to admire their unique grandeur. I even saw a few fish at Ruby and Rosalie lakes and it took a ton of self control not to drop in a line.

Unfortunately I had to keep moving as I had a king day ahead of me trying to get down to Reds. The ups and downs into each lake basin were a bit annoying but I made good time and was able to pass a few groups who all admired my quick pace up the Garnett and Shadow ascents. 

The rain started around 1 PM today and proceeded to turn into light thunderstorms the closer I got to Reds. Out in the distance I did see a ton of lightning that got closer and closer to us. Thankfully it looked like most of the heavy rain stayed in the high country but did soak a ton of unaware day hikers at Devils Postpile and Rainbow Falls.

I spent the rest of the day having beers with some of the other hikers and sharing trail stories from the last few days. I met a ton of NOBO JMT hikers who had crazy stories about the storms hitting them in the south while we shared a great burger from the Reds Cafe. After dinner I hit up the hot springs in Reds Meadow campground and enjoyed the sunset and soothed my sore muscles.
