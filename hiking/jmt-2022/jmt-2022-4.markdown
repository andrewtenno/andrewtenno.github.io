# Recap
And that’s a wrap! 

Started out the day with a breakfast burrito and coffee. After some loligagging talking to other hikers I headed south back on the JMT. My original plan was to try to exit over Duck Pass, which would have been about twice as long mileage wise and would have made for a significantly longer day. After checking the weather I made the call to instead exit early over Mammoth pass and head home early. 

The climb up from Reds was pretty long but I think I crushed it pretty well. The climb over Mammoth Pass was a bit more annoying and I definitely struggled there, likely because I didn’t have enough calories or water.

Finally I hit McCleod Lake and stopped to do some fishing and eat lunch. After about 10 minutes the dark rainclouds rolled in from the west and it began to lightly rain. I made the decision to head down the mountain, which only took about 20 minutes. After a bit of waiting the Town Trolley showed up and I made my way back to the car at Mammoth Mountain.
