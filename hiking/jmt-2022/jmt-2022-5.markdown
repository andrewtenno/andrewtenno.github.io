# Recap
I decided to kick off another JMT section by doing the South Lake to North Lake Loop. This section goes through my favorite place on the JMT - Evolution Valley. 

The hike up to Bishop Pass is pretty steep at first and then leveled out before an even steeper ascent over the last mile. I stopped and took plenty of breaks to eat and hydrate and I think I did a pretty good job of avoiding dehydration.

I passed a couple groups on the way up and waited for about 30 minutes at the top to see if they would make it up. They never did make it up while I was taking my break, but I did get a pretty crazy low flyover of a USAF plane. My guess is that they were looking for the missing hiker who was last seen around Split Mountain to the southeast but it was still pretty crazy since the plane was only about 1000 ft above me when it passed overhead. I also met another pair who had done some serious off trail adventuring over Knapsack and Thunderbolt Passes - maybe something I can build up to in the future. 

The hike down from Bishop a pass through Dusy Basin was incredible. It was amazing to descend from an inhospitable, barren landscape through wandering creeks and small lakes. I stopped at one lake to eat and rehydrate and saw some fish in the outlet creek. I spent about 30 minutes using the tenkara rod and managed to catch a tiny Golden Trout!

The rest of the day was pretty tedious and annoying - the 3k descent into Le Conte Canyon was arduous and slow, and pretty exposed in the afternoon sun. It was a hod day so the going was pretty miserable. One highlight was seeing the JMT sign and turnoff - it feels pretty damn good to be home!

I climbed up towards Big Pete Meadow and ended the day camping with a nice group of JMT-ers. It was a long day for sure but still a pretty amazing one. Stoked for tomorrow to go towards my favorite place - Evolution Valley and Muir Pass.
