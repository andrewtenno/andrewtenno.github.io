# Recap
What. A. Today was amazing. Full stop. 

I started the day with a deer sighting in Big Pete Meadow. The climb up towards Muir Pass was long and hot, and since there wasn’t any wind it was a pretty miserable slog up to the top. The scenery was absolutely beautiful - just was a bit warmer than I would have liked (at least there wasn’t any rain, though!). Helen Lake and the upper North Fork Kings drainage was quite a sight to behold.

The top of Muir Pass and the Muir Hut is always a great social experience. It was really great to talk to and hang out with other hikers, including an older woman named One Day. I really hope to have her level of energy and enthusiasm when I’m on my 70s.

The descent down from Muir Pass was pretty amazing - Wanda Lake and Lake McDermand are bright blue jewels in the midst of a seemingly inhospitable landscape. I headed quickly past them to my favorite pet of the JMT - Evolution Basin.

First stop was Sapphire Lake and the upper Evolution Creek drainage. The lake was incredibly refreshing for a quick dip and I took my time to enjoy the sheer granite cliffs reaching to the heavens around me.

Next was my favorite backcountry location in the entire Sierra Nevada - Evolution Lake. This lake’s simplicity and stunning scenery always makes me wonder if there actually is a God - ironic given the name of the lake and Basin. I’ve always had a great time admiring the beauty of this place and I decided to finally prioritize picking a campsite I truly want to enjoy instead of pushing on a few more miles. I spent the afternoon fishing, swimming, and talking to other hikers - many of whom had the same idea a Piute camping in the jewel of Kings Canyon.

I met a few different folks. I had dinner with a grandparent / daughter / granddaughter group  doing the JMT I met on Muir Pass earlier in the day.One had previously hiked the JMT and it was awesome swapping trail stories with him and his family. Another is a new grad who is enjoying the final days of her funenployment and I really am jealous that she was able to do this before starting her first full time job.

I did a bit more unsuccessful fishing while waiting for the sun to set. There were tons of beautiful Golden Trout jumping throughout the lake (especially in the outflow) but I didn’t manage to catch anything all day. Oh well - if there is any place I’d be okay with getting skunked this is definitely at the top of the list. I climbed up to my campsite and watched the sunset with another hiker. The sunset was indescribably gorgeous and I’m really glad I decided to camp up high to enjoy it in both directions.

To recap: today was a perfect day.
