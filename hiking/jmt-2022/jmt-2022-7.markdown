I decided to turn around and backtrack to South Lake / Bishop Pass. After some thinking I realized I didn’t care about Evolution Valley and Piute Pass nearly as much as another day in Evolution Basin. So far I think this was the right call - the hike up to Muir Pass was beautiful and it was great to see it Evolution Lake and Sapphire Lake in the morning light. I did a bit of fishing at Sapphire Lake but was skunked again - the tiny trout seemed to just not like my flies. I’ll have to check out a fly shop for some more recommendations.

Muir Pass itself was pretty cold and miserable - the wind was blowing quite intensely at the top of the pad and I only spent a couple minutes in the hut to warm up before heading down. I did a quick dip in one of the unnamed lakes on the way down into Le Conte Canyon and enjoyed the refreshing beauty.

Today was the first day in a long time where I’ve camped by myself. I found a beautiful site by the Kings River that was about half a mile south of the Bishop Pass junction. The site is tucked against a steam flowing over exposed granite - while still low it is quite picturesque and a was a great spot for dinner.
