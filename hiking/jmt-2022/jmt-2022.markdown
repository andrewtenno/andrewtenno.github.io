# John Muir Trail Sections - Summer 2022

## Background

After a year away I decided to revisit some of the places I loved during [my initial hike of the JMT]((/hiking/jmt-20/)). This year I divided the trip up into two sections:
- Mono Pass (Yosemite) to Mammoth Lakes
- Bishop Pass to Evolution Lake (and back!)

I primarily focused on fishing during these two trips - something I wasn't able to do much of during my thru hike.
