# John Muir Trail - Summer 2023

## Background
In 2023 I did another thru of the John Muir Trail with my brother and one of his friends. The previous winter was a record snow year in California and that made for some pretty interesting travel [compared to my experience in 2020](/hiking/jmt-20/).

## Prep
[Planning](/hiking/jmt-2023-planning)

### Gear
[Lighterpack](https://lighterpack.com/r/i0cune) 

Notes: 
- I switched from the Kakwa 40 to the HMG Southwest 3400 (which I used on my [2020 JMT Hike](/hiking/jmt-20/)) halfway through the trip for a bit more carrying capacity. 
  - The Kakwa 40 forced me to carry my bear can externally on top of the back and with the increasing chances of rain I made the decision to move to a larger pack so that I wouldn't have to worry as much about my food getting wet.
- The X-Mid Pro 1 worked pretty well, though I had some issues with condensation throughout the trip.
- Was cold a couple of nights; the 20 degree bag felt a bit insufficient at times
- I popped my Sleeping Pad while attempting to dry it out on a rock at Guitar Lake. 
- The Nightcore battery bank did not appear to agree with my Garmin Instinct. The watch would charge for a minute or two then stop.
- My Garmin Instinct likely needs to be replaced before my next long hike. The battery life was pretty poor even with most of the sensors disabled.
